# Jobhunter
Searches multiple job websites for listings based on weightings supllied by the user

## Note to Windows users
Due to a lack of support of the parallel package in Windows new listings can not be loaded within the front end. Instead use the command :-
 R -e "source('install-dir/jobsearch.R'; loadAllListings()"

where 'install-dir' is where you have Jobhunter installed.
